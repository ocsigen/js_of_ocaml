* Documentation generation
** Disable library wrapping
ocamldoc doesn't play well with module aliases and library wrapping as
done in dune. The short term solution is disable wrapping when
generating the doc. The proper solution will be to switch to odoc.

Replace (wrapped true) and (wrapped (transition ..))  by (wrapped
false) in dune files.
** make doc
** git checkout wikidoc
** git reset --hard origin/wikidoc
** make installdoc
** cd _wikidoc
** git diff # review diff
** git commit -am "sync doc" && git push origin wikidoc
** cd ..
** git push origin wikidoc
