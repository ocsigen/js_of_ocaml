// This benchmark is based on a JavaScript log processing module used
// by the V8 profiler to generate execution time profiles for runs of
// JavaScript applications, and it effectively measures how fast the
// JavaScript engine is at allocating nodes and reclaiming the memory
// used for old nodes. Because of the way splay trees work, the engine
// also has to deal with a lot of changes to the large tree object
// graph.

(* Translation in ocaml by VB:
   This program is probably not the best splay tree implementation in OCaml,
   because it tries to follow exactly the steps of the Google v8 benchmark.
