= Ppx deriver for serializing OCaml value to Json

The deriver is provided by the js_of_ocaml-ppx_deriving_json opam package.

The serialisation format follows js_of_ocaml's internal memory
representation of OCaml values. It is not meant to be used to interact
with 3rd party system.  In practice, it can be used to exchange data
between a js_of_ocaml program and a server side OCaml application.

The serialisation format allows a js_of_ocaml program to encode/decode
OCaml value efficiently by leveraging JavaScript native Json
support. See [Js_of_ocaml.Json.output] and [Js_of_ocaml.Json.output].

== Syntax

=== Generate serialisation from type definitions

One can derive serialisation functions from type definitions using
the {{{[@@deriving ..]}}} attribute.

<<code language="ocaml"|

type t = A | B
[@@deriving json]

val t_of_json : Deriving_Json_lexer.lexbuf -> t = <fun>
val t_to_json : Buffer.t -> t -> unit = <fun>
val t_json : t Deriving_Json.t = <abstr>

>>

=== Generate serialisation from types

One can generate an expression to serialise/deserialise value of an arbitrary type
with the following syntax:

<<code language="ocaml"|

let (_ : t Deriving_json.t) = [%json: t]

let (_ : string -> t) = [%of_json: t]

let (_ : t -> string) = [%to_json: t]
