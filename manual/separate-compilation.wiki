= Separate compilation

The js_of_ocaml compiler supports two compilation modes.  Whole program
compilation that compiles a bytecode executable to a single JavaScript
file and separate compilation that compiles individual compilation units
(.cmo) and libraries (.cma) to one or more javascript files.

== Why use separate compilation

Separate compilation improves the overall compilation times and gives
(many) incremental build opportunities.

Theses improvements come at the cost of bigger executable and slower
runtime.  In particular, separate compilation will disable most cross
module and cross library optimisations and make the dead-code
elimination almost useless.


== Compilation scheme

Js_of_ocaml separate compilation is somewhat similar to the OCaml
separate compilation with some differences.

The general idea is generate one JavaScript file containing the
JavaScript runtime and JavaScript files for every compilation unit (or
library) needed to run the program. One can then link (or
"concatenate") all individual JavaScript files together, respecting
the order induced by dependencies, into a single JavaScript file.

=== 1. Build the runtime

To build a standalone runtime:
{{{
js_of_ocaml build-runtime -o my-runtime.js
}}}

Additional runtime files are sometime needed and can be passed on the
command line.  In particular, some packages/libraries come with their
own runtime file.

See the <<a_manual chapter="runtime-files" |runtime files>> chapter for how to
discover these files.

=== 2. Build compilation units

In addition to bytecode executables, the js_of_ocaml compiler can
process compilation units (.cmo) and libraries (.cma).

One can specify the name of the generated file with {{{-o}}}. By
default, the name will be inferred from the input file.

By default, the js_of_ocaml compiler will generate a single JavaScript
file when compiling an ocaml library (.cma). One can choose to
generate one file per compilation unit by passing the
{{{--keep-unit-names}}} flag. In that case, the name will be inferred
from the compilation unit name and {{{-o}}} will be understood as a
destination directory.

{{{
js_of_ocaml modname.cmo
#generates modname.js

js_of_ocaml libname.cma
#generates libname.js

js_of_ocaml libname.cma -o name.js
#generates name.js

mkdir libname
js_of_ocaml libname.cma --keep-unit-names -o libname/
#generates libname/Unit1.js libname/Unit2.js
}}}

=== 3. Link

The final step is to link all individual JavaScript files into a
single one.  The {{{link}}} command of the js_of_ocaml-compiler takes
a list of JavaScript filename as input and concatenates them all
(merging source-maps together if needed).

{{{
js_of_ocaml link my-runtime.js stdlib.js libname.js modname.js std_exit.js-o myexe.js
}}}

Note that, unlike the ocaml compiler, the ocaml stdlib and std_exit need to be
passed explicitly (here, {stdlib.js} and {std_exit.js} are the result of compiling
{stdlib.cma} and {std_exit.cmo}).

== Support in dune

Support for js_of_ocaml separate compilation has been added to dune
(previously jbuilder). The separate compilation mode is selected when
the build profile is dev, which is the default.  There is currently no
other way to control this behaviour.

See [[https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jsoo.html|dune documentation]]

== Source-maps support

Separate compilation can be used together with source-map.  The
recommended way is to build all individual javascript files with
inlined source-map by passing {{{--source-map-inline}}} to
{{{js_of_ocaml}}}.

Note that other configurations have not been well tested and might
require additional tuning.

== Building Toplevel

Building a toplevel using separate compilation is not supported / has
not been tested yet.
