== Effect handlers ==

Js_of_ocaml supports effect handlers with the {{{--enable=effects}}}
flag. This is based on transformation of the whole program to
continuation-passing style.
As a consequence, [[tailcall|tail calls]] are also fully optimized.
This is not the default for now since the generated code is slower,
larger and less readable.
The [[performances|performance impact]] is especially large for code
that involves a lot of function calls without allocation, since the
transformation introduces many intermediate continuation
functions.
We hope to improve on this by transforming the code only partially to
continuation-passing style, and by trying alternative compilation
strategies.
