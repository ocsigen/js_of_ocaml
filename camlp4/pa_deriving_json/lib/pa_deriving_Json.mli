(** Deriving_json syntax extension (based on the {i deriving} library).
    @see <https://github.com/ocsigen/deriving> the source code of {i deriving}
    @see <http://code.google.com/p/deriving/> the documentation of the original {i deriving} library by Jeremy Yallop.

val register_predefs : Type.qname -> Type.qname -> unit
(** [register_predefs typeA typeB] tells the syntax extension
    that [typeB] is an alias for [typeA].
    The extension syntax will then use the deriving_json implementation
    of [typeB] in place of [typeA]'s one.

    Important note: TypeB does NOT HAVE TO actually exists.

    In practive, you may need to use this in the following cases:
     - use deriving_json on types from external libraries that do not use deriving
     - use deriving_json on abstract types
