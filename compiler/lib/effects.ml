(* The following CPS transform is based on the one proposed in D.
   Hillerström, S. Lindley, R. Atkey, and K. C. Sivaramakrishnan,
   “Continuation Passing Style for Effect Handlers” (FSCD 2017), with
   adaptations to account for exception handlers (which are not
   considered in detail in the paper) and for the fact that the
   language is an SSA form rather than a classical lambda calculus.

   Rather than using a stack of continuations, and effect and
   exception handlers, only the current continuation is passed between
   functions, while exception handlers and effect handlers are stored
   in global variables. This avoid having to manipulate the stack each
   time the current continuation changes. This also allows us to deal
   with exceptions from the runtime or from JavaScript code (a [try
   ... with] at the top of stack can have access to the current
   exception handler and resume the execution from there; see the
   definition of runtime function [caml_callback]).

                   one a the previous blocks. When there is a single
                   previous block, this is exactly what we want. For a
                   merge node, the variable is not used so we can just
                   as well use it. For a loop, we don't want the
                   return value of a call right before entering the
                   loop to be overriden by the value returned by the
                   last call in the loop. So, we may need to use an
                   additional closure to bind it, and we have to use a
                   fresh variable here *)
