(** Base64 RFC4648 implementation.

    Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent
    binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64
    representation.  It is specified in RFC 4648. *)

val default_alphabet : string
(** A 64-character string specifying the regular Base64 alphabet. *)

val uri_safe_alphabet : string
(** A 64-character string specifying the URI- and filename-safe Base64
    alphabet. *)

val decode : ?alphabet:string -> string -> string
(** [decode s] decodes the string [s] that is encoded in Base64 format.
    Will leave trailing NULLs on the string, padding it out to a multiple
    of 3 characters. [alphabet] defaults to {!default_alphabet}.
    @raise Not_found if [s] is not a valid Base64 string.  *)

val encode : ?pad:bool -> ?alphabet:string -> string -> string
(** [encode s] encodes the string [s] into base64. If [pad] is false,
    no trailing padding is added.
    [pad] defaults to [true], and [alphabet] to {!default_alphabet}. *)
