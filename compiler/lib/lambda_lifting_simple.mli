val f : to_lift:Var.Set.t -> program -> program * Var.t Var.Map.t
(** Lambda-lift all functions of the program that are in [to_lift]. All
    functions are lifted to toplevel. Functions that may be
    mutually recursive are lifted together. Also yields a map from the original
    function names to the names of their lambda-lifted counterparts. E.g.
    consider:

        let y = -3 in
        (* ... *)
        let rec fib n =
                match n with
                | 0 | 1 -> 1
                | _ -> fib (n-1) + fib (n-2) + y
        in
        fib 42

    After lambda-lifting of [fib], it will look like:

      let y = -3 in
      (* ... *)
      let fib' y =
              let rec fib_l n =
                      match n with
                      | 0 | 1 -> 1
                      | _ -> fib_l (n-1) + fib_l (n-2) + y
              in
              fib_l
      in
      let fib = fib' y in
      fib 42

      [fib_l] is the lifted version of [fib], [fib'] is the lifting closure.

      Note that putting a function's name in [to_lift] is not a guarantee that
      it will be lambda-lifted: a function may end up unlifted if it has no
      free variables.
