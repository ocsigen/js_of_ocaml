(*

Store some toplevel values into globals. Any variable which is used a
number of instructions after being defined is stored into a global
instead of a local. The goals are the following:
- Turn a large number of closures into constant closures, which has a
  significant impact on performance
- Reduce the compilation time of the toplevel function in case the
  Wasm engine decide to optimize it: reduce the register pressure by
  avoiding long-lived registers in the toplevel function, and make
  load elimination less expensive by reducing the number of constant
  structures defined in this function.
