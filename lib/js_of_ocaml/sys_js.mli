val set_channel_flusher : out_channel -> (string -> unit) -> unit
(** Set a callback to be called when an out_channel flush its buffer.
      [set_channel_flusher chan cb] install the callback [cb] for [chan] out_channel.
      [cb] will be called with the string to flush. *)

val set_channel_filler : in_channel -> (unit -> string) -> unit
(** Set a callback to be called when an in_channel wants to fill its
      buffer. [set_channel_filler chan cb] install the called [cb] for
      [chan] in_channel. The string returned by [cb] will be appended
      to the channel buffer. *)

val mount_point : unit -> string list

val unmount : path:string -> unit

val mount : path:string -> (prefix:string -> path:string -> string option) -> unit
(** Register a callback to the [path] to dynamicly load missing files.
      Whenever a file is missing in [path], the callback is used to optionally
      get the content of the file.
      [mount ~path f] register the callback [f] to the path [path].
      The callback [f] receives [(prefix,suffix)] where:
       - [prefix] is the path the function has been registered to.
       - [Filename.contact prefix suffix] is the absolute filename .*)

val read_file : name:string -> string
(** [read_file name] returns the content of the file [name].
      Raise [Not_found] if the file does not exists. *)

val create_file : name:string -> content:string -> unit
(** Register a file to a Pseudo Filesystem.
      [create_file ~name ~content] register the file [name] with content [content]
      so it can be be opened with [open_in name] *)

val update_file : name:string -> content:string -> unit
(** Update a file in the Pseudo Filesystem.
