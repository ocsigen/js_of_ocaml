(** This module contains a few types and values to ease the use of CSS properties
    and such. If you think a feature is missing, consider sending a patch or an
    RFE to the mailing list.

    This module contain submodules each with a signature similar to:
    {[
      type t            (* type the module is focused on *)
      type js_t         (* valid js representation of values of type t *)
      val js: t -> js_t (* conversion *)
      val ml: js_t -> t (* conversion *)
    ]}
    Additional functions (string conversion, standard operation, etc.) are
    sometime available. Some module have several different types instead of just
    one.

(**Gives the string equivalent of the argument.*)
val string_of_name : name -> string

(**Converts a color name into three integers representing the Red, Green and
  Blue channels. Channel values are in between [0] and [255].*)
val rgb_of_name : name -> (int * int * int)

(** Convert a tuple of three integers between [0] and [255] into a hex
    string *)
val hex_of_rgb : (int * int * int) -> string

(**The type of colors, either by name, by Red-Green-Blue constructor or by
   Hue-Saturation-Lightness constructors.*)
type t =

  | Name of name
  (**A color by name*)

  | RGB of (int * int * int)
  (**Red, Green and Blue values. Clipped to [0..255] by most (All?)
     browsers.*)

  | RGB_percent of (int * int * int)
  (**RBG channels are specified as a percentage of their maximal value.*)

  | RGBA of (int * int * int * float)
  (**Same as RGB with additionnal transparency argument. Opacity should be
    between [0.] (completely transparent) and [1.] (completely opaque).*)

  | RGBA_percent of (int * int * int * float)
  (**RGB channels specified as percentage of their maximal value. Alpha
    channel (opacity) is still a [0.] to [1.] float.*)

  | HSL of (int * int * int)
  (**Hue, Saturation and Lightness values. Hue is an angle in degree (in
     interval [0..360]). Saturation is a percentage ([0..100]) with [0]
     being colorless. Lightness is also a percentage ([0..100]) with [0]
     being black.*)

  | HSLA of (int * int * int * float)
  (**Same as HSL with an opacity argument between [0.] and [1.].*)


(**build a color from the values of red, green, and blue channels. optional [a]
   argument can be used to specify alpha channel (aka opacity).*)
val rgb : ?a:float -> int -> int -> int -> t

(**build a color from the values of hue, saturation, and lightness channels.
   optional [a] argument can be used to specify alpha channel (aka opacity).*)
val hsl : ?a:float -> int -> int -> int -> t

(**A [js_t] is a valid string representation of a CSS color*)
type js_t = private Js.js_string Js.t

(**A few conversion functions*)

(**Convert to a string representation (for debugging purpose mainly).*)
val string_of_t: t -> string

(**Projection from OCaml to Js. [js c] is equivalent
to [Js.string (string_of_t c)] but with a [js_t] return type.*)
val js : t -> js_t

(**Projection from Js to OCaml. The function is the dual of [js].*)
val ml: js_t -> t

(**Checks the well-formedness of a string or fails with [Invalid_argument]*)
val js_t_of_js_string : Js.js_string Js.t -> js_t
