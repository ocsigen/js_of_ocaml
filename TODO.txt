Libraries
=========
- object literals
    {:m = 1; n = "abcd":} : [> `m of int; `n of string] Js.record Js.t
  ==> usual rule for mapping field names; check for no duplicate.
- array literals
  in particular, heterogeneous arrays...
        ('a, 'b, 'c) t ???

    module Tuple : sig
      type 'a tuple
      val e : unit tuple
      val a : 'a tuple -> 'b -> ('a * 'b) tuple

      type ('a, 'b) acc
      val first : ('a * 'b, 'b) acc
      val next : ('a, 'b) acc -> ('c * 'a, 'b) acc
      val get : 'a tuple -> ('a, 'b) acc -> 'b
      val set : 'a tuple -> ('a, 'b) acc -> 'b -> unit
    end = struct
      type 'a tuple = 'a
      let e = ()
      let a x y = (x, y)
    end

   <_0: t0; _1: t1; _n: tn> t

Benchmarks/examples
===================
- polishing
- check canvas availability in examples
- finish planet (no cpu when not moving / not visible)
- take examples from http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/?
- planets (+satellites?) ===> Runge-Kutta
- 3D effects: http://gyu.que.jp/jscloth/
              http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1584854/how-to-draw-3d-sphere

Compiler optimizations
======================
- "unsafe" option: no check for division by zero / array access
- per module options: we could apply "unsafe" and "inline" options
  selectively

- syntactic sugar for Javascript literal strings
  + optimization to avoid going through Caml strings

- Can we avoid spurious conversions from boolean to integers???
  ===> explicit conversion to boolean; specialized "if" that operates
       on booleans directly

- constant hoisting (including functions, out of loops and functions)
- inline also partially applied functions

- we should check stack compatibility when parsing:
  when jumping somewhere, the stack should keep the same shape

- Improved optimizations
  ==> cross-function optimizations
  ==> deadcode elimination inside blocks
  (for instance, elimination of function which are defined in a
   functor but are not used)

==========================
==========================

Special case for shortcut boolean operations...

     1
     |\
     | \2
     | /\
     |/  \
     3    4

Float <-> hex

Filling a string
================
  function stringFill3(x, n) {
    var s = '';
    for (;;) {
      if (n & 1) s += x;
      n >>= 1;
      if (n) x += x;
      else break;
    }
    return s;
  }

Conversion string <-> array
===========================

Byte array ==> string
=====================
int array --map--> string array --join--> string
   b[i] = toString[a[i]]  where toString is a precomputed array of strings

Bigint
======

==========================

BUGS
====
- ISINT is compiled to "not a block"; document this deviation
  (or document that we should not rely on the Obj module)

PERFORMANCE
===========
- should we rebind variables from a deeper level ?
  (only if used more than once...)

     var x = ...
     function () {
        var y = x;
        ... y .... y ... y ....
     }

IMPROVEMENTS
============

- be more cautious regarding how we print floats...
  (is it accurate?)
  ==> gdtoa
    http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2002/12/2813f8e8be115b0bad1bc16b1e41b744.en.html

- explicit conversion from int to boolean

NEW FEATURES
============

- Can we use the debugger information to generate specialized code?
  (Use objects rather than arrays for tuples, ...)

DATA REPRESENTATION
===================
- should wrap Ocaml exceptions (more robust code)...
  ==> use Error object as base object, special "message" method

DATA ANALYSIS
=============
- interprocedural analysis

COMPRESSION OPTIMIZATION
========================
- http://timepedia.blogspot.com/2009/08/on-reducing-size-of-compressed.html
  http://timepedia.blogspot.com/2009/11/traveling-salesman-problem-and.html
  ==> order functions by similarity
  ==> 7-zip is better at compressing than gzip, with the same algorithm...

DOCUMENTATION
=============
document as much as we can:
* the representation of datas, closures, ...
* the assumption we make regarding the bytecode
  ==> ISINT

================================

==================================

Use window.postMessage instead of setTimeout for yield (setTimeout
always waits a bit!)
==> but window.postMessage is synchronous in IE8
    + does not cooperate well with other users of message events

==================================

Could we generate ocaml bytecode as well? (bytecode optimizer)
LLVM code?

Targeting JAVA / .net seem harder: not type information...

==================================

http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~montela/ocamil/
Note that the OCamIL compilers and tools are currently based on OCaml
v3.06. An upgrade to the latest OCaml version is scheduled for the
next release.
[Never happened...]

ocamldefun (on ocaml_beginners)
I'd really like to play around ocamldefun, but it seems to only work
with ocaml 3.06. Has anyone had luck setting this up in more recent
versions of ocaml?

OCamlexc (on caml list)
So I was wondering if there is any current or recent projects (or interests)
to resume OCamlExc development and complete the set of handled constructs,
as I'm afraid I'll have neither the time nor the skills to do the job.
