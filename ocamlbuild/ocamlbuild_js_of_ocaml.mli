(** Ocamlbuild plugin to build with js_of_ocaml *)

(**
   {2 Initialize}

   Initialize the js_of_ocaml ocamlbuild plugin with the following
   code in {i myocamlbuild.ml}:
   {[
     let _ = Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch Ocamlbuild_js_of_ocaml.dispatcher
   ]}
   {b Side note}: {!Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch} should be used only
   once. The last call will override previous ones.

   {3 With Oasis}

   If you use oasis, {b myocamlbuild.ml} should look like:
   {[
     let _ =
       Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch
         (fun hook ->
            dispatch_default hook;
            Ocamlbuild_js_of_ocaml.dispatcher
              ~oasis_executables:["src/yourprogram.byte"]
              hook;
         )
   ]}


   {2 Build }

   Build a JavaScript program {b myprog.js} by calling the command:
   {[
     ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -plugin-tag "package(js_of_ocaml.ocamlbuild)" myprog.js
   ]}
   It will first build the bytecode {b myprog.byte} and finally produce {b myprog.js} (in {b _build}).


   {2 Options}

   One can pass option to the Js_of_ocaml compiler using tags.
   See <<a_manual chapter="options" |Options>>.

   Available tags:
   - {b pretty}: Pretty print the generated javascript.
   - {b debuginfo}: Output debug information.
   - {b noinline}: Disable inlining
   - {b sourcemap}: Generate sourcemap
   - {b tailcall(none)}: Set the tailcall optimisation (default "trampoline")
   - {b opt(3)}: Set the compilation profile (default 1)
   - {b debug}: enables {b pretty}, {b debuginfo}, {b sourcemap}


   {3 Exemples}

   In the {b _tags} file:
   {[
     <myprog.js>:pretty, opt(3)
   ]}


   {2 Dispatchers} *)

val dispatcher :
  ?oasis_executables:Ocamlbuild_plugin.Pathname.t list -> Ocamlbuild_plugin.hook -> unit
(** The main dispatcher

    [?oasis_executables] is the paths of the executables
    (having the .byte extension) you want to compile
    as a javascript executable. The former executables are still compiled.

    Side note: {!Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch} should be used only once as
    it record only one function for an ocamlbuild module.
*)

(** {2 Low level functions} *)

val oasis_support : executables:Ocamlbuild_plugin.Pathname.t list -> unit
(** Map each targets given as argument to ocamlbuild and replace each element
    that exists in [~executables] by its corresponding .js target.
*)
